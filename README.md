# SharpeningJigs
These pucks are designed to be used manually on a flat diamond hone or knife sharpener as well as on lapping machines.  The carbide cutters are called split end or half straight.
The pucks and goniostats can be 3d printed with 30% infill.  The 3dPrintModifier may be used in slicer software to increase infill to 100% around the holes in the pucks.
