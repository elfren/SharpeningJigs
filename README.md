# SharpeningJigs
These jigs are designed to be used manually on a flat diamond hone or knife sharpener.  The carbide cutters are called split end or half straight.
The jigs can be 3d printed with 30% infill.  They are to be used with .125" bits.  The top hole should be threaded for an 8-32 bolt which is used to secure the cutter in the jig.
